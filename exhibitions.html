            <p class="text">
                Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
                ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and 
                know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations 
                and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used 
                the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, 
                to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

        <section class="evolution__section">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Evolution</h2>

            <p class="text">
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled
                with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did 
                we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework 
                for exploring and understanding our place in this world. Discover the origins of life 
                on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take 
                some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the 
                Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

        <section class="biology__section">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Biology and Medicine</h2>

            <p class="text">
                From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs
                in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders 
                of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer 
                and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding 
                of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take 
                a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart 
                transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also 
                from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

        <section class="robotics__section">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Robotics and AI</h2>

            <p class="text">
                The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial 
                intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home applications 
                of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say 
                hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

        <section class="ecology__section">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Ecology</h2>

            <p class="text">
                As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having 
                on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore 
                how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet. 
                In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including 
                global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways 
                we can all contribute to a brighter future.
