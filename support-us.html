                museum open and accessible to the whole community. You can also support us 
                by donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have some item or 
                ollection that you think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Volunteer</h2>

            <p class="text">
                A number of people volunteer their time and effort to 
                keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come 
                and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind 
                the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly 
                lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits 
                and strategies for the museum. You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please 
                contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
