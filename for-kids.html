                Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, 
                there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, 
                or why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed 
                to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.

                During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs 
                where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of 
                discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more 
                about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

            <p class="text">
                As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places of learning and 
                exploring. Our team are on hand to give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our 
                learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and inspire them. Please 
                get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students 
                through for a visit.
